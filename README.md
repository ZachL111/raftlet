# raftlet

`raftlet` is a focused Java codebase around simulate Raft log replication, terms, and commit indexes. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Raftlet Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the distributed systems idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## How It Is Put Together

The interesting part is the boundary between accepted and reviewed scenarios. Extended examples sit near that boundary so future edits can show whether the model became more permissive or more cautious. The Java implementation uses a compact package layout and direct assertion checks.

## Reason For The Project

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Capabilities

- Uses fixture data to keep quorum behavior changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for lease timing, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents message ordering tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Data Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Where Things Live

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Getting It Running

Use a normal shell with Java available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Tradeoffs

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.

## Possible Extensions

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more distributed systems fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
